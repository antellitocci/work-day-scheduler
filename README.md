## What's Here

* A work event scheduler that displays the current date and time blocks for standard working hours (9am - 5pm)
* The time blocks are color coded to indicate whether they are in the past (gray), present (red), future (green)
* The time block colors are audited every 15 minutes using a setInterval
* A user can enter an event in a time block, click the save button, and the event will be saved to localStorage
* Events saved to localStorage are given an ID that corresponds to the appropriate time block and saved along with the text of the event
* Should a user wish to remove an event, they can clear the text, hit save, and the event will be removed from localStorage
* Should a user wish to remove all events, they can click the Delete All Items button and the events will be removed from the page as well as localStorage
* Minor edits to Bootstrap styling were made to make the page more mobile friendly
